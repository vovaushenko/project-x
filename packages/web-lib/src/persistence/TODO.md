- instantiation of web store (think how to initialize different kinds of stores (knowing that indexdb needs instantiation))
- implement simple atomic operations (getOne || getOneByKey, deleteByKey, saveOne, | updateByKey) -> implement for local and session store
- research about index db -> how it works and what it supports
- we'll work to make this typesafe (by using generics)
